** Encode a binary buffer "in" of size n bytes so that it contains
** no instances of characters '\'' or '\000'.  The output is 
** null-terminated and can be used as a string value in an INSERT
** or UPDATE statement.  Use sqlite_decode_binary() to convert the
** string back into its original binary.
**
** The result is written into a preallocated output buffer "out".
** "out" must be able to hold at least (256*n + 1262)/253 bytes.
** In other words, the output will be expanded by as much as 3
** bytes for every 253 bytes of input plus 2 bytes of fixed overhead.
** (This is approximately 2 + 1.019*n or about a 2% size increase.)
