This is the MySociety.org NotApathetic.com code
repository.

To run NotApathetic.com, you need an Apache webserver
MySQL database (although it should be relatively easy
to port to another database if necessary).

Perl modules needed are:
        Mail::Mailer;
        XML::RSS;
        CGI;
        DBI;
        Date::Manip;
        Email::Valid;
        HTML::Entities;
        HTML::Scrubber;
        Mail::Mailer;
        Text::Wrap;
        XML::Simple;
many of them are installed by default with Perl.

Files that you need to edit
    copy 
        cgi-bin/mysociety/NotApathetic/Config.pm-incvs
    to 
         cgi-bin/mysociety/NotApathetic/Config.pm
and edit the relevant lines.

There are a selection of SSI files which need editing:
    includes/header.shtml
    includes/footer.shtml
All design of the site is controlled through those files,
along with the stylesheet /na.css
You may find grep useful when trying to track through
some of the includes. Please let us know where 
NotApathetic.com is hardcoded into the site, so we
can remove it for the people who follow you.


Pages which will need rewriting for each site are: 
    about/index.shtml (including email address)
    news/index.shtml
    includes/description.shtml
    about/privacy/index.shtml

Similarly, some images in /images/ and favicon.ico
will need replacing with your images.

If you get error messages from Apache immediately on installation,
you may need to edit the .htaccess files for your local server. The
defaults will probably work.


For the site admin interface, you will need to edit /admin/.htaccess
to point it at a .htpasswd file. The username that 
performs admin functions is included in the notifications. You might
want to put it on a SSL server or similar.




Finally, once it's working, please email mysociety-na@mysociety.org to 
tell us about your site so we can take a look at what you've done.
We are also willing to accept diffs which add non-site-specific
functionality which make life easier for those who install it after you.
