<h1>WriteToThem - Benefits</h1>

<p id="sub">The world&#8217;s most effective way of putting citizens in touch with their representatives</p>

<h2>Your logo and colours</h2>

<p>We customise WriteToThem to have your organisation's branding. This can be 
anything from a simple coat of paint with your logo in the corner, to a
complete design looking seemlessly like part of your website.
</p>

<h2>Letter-writing tips</h2>

<p>On your cobranded site, you can display text reminding your supporters
of points they might want to make in their letter. This appears just
above their letter while they are writing it. You can change this text
according to the campaign you are running.
</p>

<h2>Return to your site afterwards</h2>

<p>When your supporter confirms their message, they are redirected to a
confirmation page on your site. This gives you the chance to suggest
follow up actions. It also lets you track how many people completed
their message.
</p>

<h2>Campaign coding</h2>

<p>Have multiple campaigns and keep track of them. You can invent as many
"campaign codes" as you like. For each one, change both the letter writing
tips, and the address on the site your support returns to after writing
their letter. 
</p>

<h2>Tracking success</h2>

<p>We generate a report for you of how many messages are sent via your
cobranded site each day. This includes breakdown of type of representative
- whether MP, MEP, Councillor etc. For all messages sent through WriteToThem
we monitor whether the constituent got a response within 2 to 3 weeks. We
also provide this information for your campaign.
