This is the MySociety.org NotApathetic.com code
repository.

To run NotApathetic.com, you need an Apache webserver
MySQL database (although it should be relatively easy
to port to another database if necessary).

Perl modules needed are:
        Mail::Mailer;
        XML::RSS;
        CGI;
        DBI;
        Date::Manip;
        Email::Valid;
        HTML::Entities;
        HTML::Scrubber;
        Mail::Mailer;
        Text::Wrap;
        XML::Simple;
many of them are installed by default with Perl.

Files that you need to edit
    copy 
        cgi-bin/mysociety/NotApathetic/Config.pm-incvs
    to 
         cgi-bin/mysociety/NotApathetic/Config.pm
and edit the relevant lines.

There are a selection of SSI files which need editing:
    includes/header.shtml
    includes/footer.shtml
All design of the site is controlled through those files,
along with the stylesheet
    /na.css
You may find grep useful when trying to track down
some of the includes. Please let us know where 
NotApathetic.com is hardcode into the site, so we
can remove it for the people who follow you.

Pages which will need rewriting for each site are:
    about/index.shtml
    news/index.shtml

Similarly, some images in /images/ and favicon.ico
will need editing and replacing with your images.

Finally, email mysociety-na@mysociety.org to us about
your site so we can take a look at what you've done.
We are always willing to accept diffs which add 
non-site-specific functionality.
