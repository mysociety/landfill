.SH NAME
cvstrac \- Low\-ceremony bug tracker for projects under CVS

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B cvstrac [ command\ [ params\ ...\ ]\ ... ]

.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B cvstrac
command is used to run the CVSTrac web service, or to initialise
new databases for projects.

.PP
Please read the section titled
.B Security and Setup
for details of the default password and why you should change it.

.PP
This manual page was written for the Debian distribution because the
original program source does contain a manual page. However CVSTrac is
well documented at the CVSTrac Wiki, <http://www.cvstrac.org/cvstrac/wiki>,
and you will be able to fin d more up-to-date information there.

.PP
.SH OPTIONS
Running cvstrac without options produces a usage message. A summary of
the command sequences which can be passed to cvstrac is included
below. For more details, see
.I /usr/share/doc/cvstrac
on this system.

.TP
.B chroot dir user
Tells cvstrac to put itself into the chroot gaol
.B dir
and switch to the named user, dropping root privileges. These three
parameters must be the first passed to cvstrac, and processing of
command line parameters continues as normal after the chroot.

.TP
.B init dir project
Initialises a new CVSTrac database.
.B dir
is the name of the directory in which you want the database to reside,
and
.B project
is the name of the project that CVSTrac will be hosting. The database
file will be created as
.I dir/project.db

.PP
The following parameters cause CVSTrac to begin responding to HTTP
requests by various methods. You will need to set up the database
before use to ensure that only authorised users have administrative
access.
.B PLEASE READ
and understand the section below entitled
.B Security and Setup
before using these commands, because unless you understand what to do
you'll be leaving your system vulnerable to arbitrary code execution
as the user invoking CVSTrac.

.TP
.B http dir [ project ]
Causes CVSTrac to start running as an HTTP server on the standard
input, displaying responses to the standard out.
.B dir
should be the name of a directory holding project database or
databases created by
.I cvstrac init
and
.B project
is the name of a project database without the ".db" extension, as for
.I cvstrac init.
If the latter option is given, access is restricted to just the named
project DB, and the access URL will change slightly. See below for
details.

.TP
.B cgi dir [ project ]
Causes CVSTrac to respond as a CGI script.
.B dir
and
.B project
are interpreted as for
.I cvstrac http.
This invocation can be installed into a simple shell or Perl CGI
script anywhere on a server supporting the Common Gateway Interface.

.TP
.B server port dir [ project ]
Causes CVSTrac to run as a self-hosted HTTP server on the specified
port.
.B dir
and 
.B project
are interpreted as above.

.SH Access to CVSTrac

CVSTrac accesses databases created by its own
.B init
command, and is accessed remotely by HTTP. If you did not specify a
single project to access in any of the
.B http,
.B cgi,
or
.B server
commands, then the running CVSTrac instance can be used to access any
database in that directory simply by modifying the URL, but you will
need to supply the name of the database in order to access it.

.PP
For self-hosted
.B server
instances of CVSTrac, and
.B http
instances started from inetd, the URL to use is of the form

.PP
.RS
http://hostname[:port]/
.RE
.PP
if you specified a project in the invocation, or
.PP
.RS
http://hostname[:port]/project/
.RE
.PP
if you didn't.

.PP
If running as a CGI script, simply use the URL you would normally use
for the CGI script, with the project name you wish to access tacked on
if necessary, as above.

.PP
For details of the default password, and why you should change it,
read on!


.SH Security and Setup

Once CVSTrac is installed and running, you should immediately access
it as the setup user, and change the password. The username and
password of the setup user are both "setup". Passwords, rather
counterintuitively, are changed by following the "Logout" hyperlink at
the bottom of the main menu on the start screen.

.PP
The setup user is able, in normal operation, to configure the service
in a way that can cause arbitrary code to be executed under the same
userid as CVSTrac itself. You should be aware of this, and the fact
that this can easily lead to more serious exploits if the setup user
is compromised.

.PP
The chroot functionality described above is not a perfect fix for
this, but can be used as an additional security measure. See the
section below entitled
.B Runtime Dependencies
for details of what binaries the chroot gaol will need.


.SH Access to the CVS repository
CVSTrac should be installed running as a user with read access to the
CVS repository specified during the interactive setup. Certain
commands, such as the ability to modify
.I CVSROOT/passwd
require the write permissions too.


.SH Runtime Dependencies
Besides its libraries, CVSTrac requires the following binaries by
default: 
.B co,
.B rcsdiff,
.B rlog
and
.B diff.
If running cvstrac on a Debian system, these will have been installed
as dependencies of the
.I cvstrac
package, or as part of the base system.
