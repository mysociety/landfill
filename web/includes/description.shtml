		<h2>About Not Apathetic</h2>
		<p>NotApathetic was built so that people who are planning not to vote
		in the UK General Election on May 5th can tell the world why. We won't
		try to persuade you that voting is a good or a bad idea - we're just
		here to record and share your explanations. Whether ideological,
		practical or other, any	reason will do.</p>
