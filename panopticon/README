mySociety Panopticon

This is the code for the mysociety panopticon - fetch lots
of RSS feeds (including those from aggregators like Google
Blogs and friends). it then puts it on the web in a nice and
friendly way. There are email scripts available if you want
them, but they're not here yet. This code is the base of the
UK Government News aggregator www.TheGovernmentSays.com.



Installing


To install it, it should just work if you use your own
virtual host for this. If you want the panopticon in a
subdirectory, edit web/includes/config.shtml

Copy cgi-bin/PanopticonConfig.pm-incvs to be 
cgi-bin/PanopticonConfig.pm

You then need to create mysql using schema.sql, and then
edit the username/password/dsn string in PanopticonConfig.pm
This needs symlinking to the bin directory and also the
admin cgi directory (or inclusion some other way).

You may need to edit bin/go to set the paths to be where you
made the checkout (and where you want things to be).

Links will be fetched and cached in the cache directory
unless this is turned off in the config file. You will
probably want to set an apache alias to map /cache/ onto
wherever your cache directory is on disc.
