<ul>

<li>All people in the lists are voluntarily opted in.
<li>Extremely simple for councillors to publicise and add people to their lists.
<li>Zero required front or back end integration with council IT systems.
<li>Provides trustworthy public space for discussion online.
<li>Currently just under 12,000 people signed up to HearFromYourMP across the UK.
<li>So easy and attractive that over 20% of MPs offered the opportunity have used the Westminster version of the service in the first 3 months of service.
</ul>

<h2>How does it work?</h2>

<p>When a council expresses an interest in using the system, we write to the
current subscribers in each ward of a council and ask if would be interested in
hearing from their councillors, as well as their MP. There are already more
than 25 council containing over 100 people signed up to HearFromYourMP, all of
whom we can ask about hearing from their councillors.</p>

<p>Once we enable the system, our site calculates how many people are signed up
in each ward. If the total is 5 or more, we send an email to the relevant
councillor(s) saying &#8220;There are 5 people in your ward who would like to hear
from you about local issues &mdash; hit reply to talk to them&#8221;. All the councillor
has to be able to do is hit reply and type an email &mdash; there is no new learning
involved.</p>

<p>Given our highly positive experience with MPs, we expect that a no-fuss, low
skill email list and discussion system will prove popular amongst councillors
across the UK.</p>
