<h1>HearFromYourCouncillor competition</h1>

<p id="sub">Enter our competition and get HearFromYourCouncillor for free.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.hearfromyourmp.com/">HearFromYourMP.com</a>
is a simple and popular democratic website that
builds up email lists which MPs can then email to kick-off discussions
about local issues.</p>

<p>Although only 18 months old HearFromYourMP has already been used by
over 100 members of Parliament to talk with groups of their
constituents, and mySociety is now set on transferring this success
into the council world.</p>

<p>If you've never used HearFromYourMP.com we strongly suggest you sign
up, and take a quick read through <a
href="http://www.hearfromyourmp.com/about">our About page</a> explaining
how it works and what makes it so much more well used than standard
discussion forums or online consultations. Over 32,000 people are
signed up across the UK, with the number rising steadily.</p>

<p>The competition is simple. Before April 15th we ask councils who are
interested simply to tell us what they'd do to ensure
HearFromYourCouncillor gets a healthy start in their area. The sort of
thing we're looking for is a commitment to publicise the service from
the site homepage, or to include it in print materials. After April
15th we'll assess the different non-monetary offers we've been made,
and pick two winners based on how seriously we think councils will
take our offer of a free service. We will then build and customise
HearFromYourCouncillor in conjunction with local authority web teams,
and launch as soon as possible after the local elections, running for
a year for free.</p>

<p>To contact mySociety with any questions about this or any other
project, please email <a href="mailto:team&#64;mysociety.org">team&#64;mysociety.org</a>.</p>
