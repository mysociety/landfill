It will always think you are in manchester gorton because the API to do the postcode lookups is restricted. The HFYMP feed is empty.

While the box you get at the end contains real live data, it is completely dynamically generated, and also has no wrapping/style applied.


<p>
ToDo, in a rough order
<ul>
	<!-- <li>style it suitably for richard pope's design (an hour or two) -->
	<li>allow generation of amias' output when his is done
	<!-- <li>Abstract out more of the design stuff (an hour or two based on the above) -->
	<li>move to mysoc, and use the postcode lookup api (probably far too long)
	<li>Put in generation layer, so browsers don't hit the db just disc (an hour)
	<li>Sensible defaults. (10 mins)
	<li>Document creation so that you don't need to use a webbrowser (you can just POST things the right things to the right address)
	<!-- <li>RSS2.0 output as well as JS (for Richard Pope's thing and other rss readers) -->
</ul>

feeds we're obviously missing
<ul>
	<li>per mp feed for hfymp
	<li>how my mp voted on interesting divisons from PW
	<li>What else could be an option?
</ul>
