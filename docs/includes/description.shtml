<h3 class="green">About the site</h3>
<ul id="sitelinks" class="pins">
    <li>Hello, and welcome to Placeopedia, a simple site where you can connect
Wikipedia articles with places, and then make use of our database either to browse, or 
syndicate the whole lot. We hope that lots of people will connect
places they know with their corresponding Wikipedia article, and then
our <a href="/data/">syndicated data</a> can be used as a general geographic lookup table
for Wikipedia.          
</li>
<li><strong>Latest news:</strong>
We've made the map a little bit wider, so New Zealanders don't feel left out. :)
Also, while the map still shows only the latest 15 additions, we've added a count
underneath the map of the number of pins <em>not</em> shown on the map. Zoom in and
pan around to make them appear.
<li>We've also set up a
<a href="http://www.mysociety.org/mailman/listinfo/mysociety-maps">public discussion list</a>
for people interested in the development of the open source software that Placeopedia runs on.
