ToDo.

this list is not exhaustive, contact sam for stuff to do with it.



	a way of editing style info (styleinfo table)
		- text boxes for content, drop down to select header/footer,
		  tag to enter name of design.

	a better way of adding new urls/sources (feeds table)
		- add URL and also attach to constituency
		- add URL with placeholder for postcode.




Stuff I have in my sights
	Write a script to generate iframe/js/rss
		- mostly done (not necessarily committed)
		- attach to the go script to update as soon as feed fetching
		  is done. Only regenerates boxes which have changed content.
