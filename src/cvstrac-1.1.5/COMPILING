How To Compile CVSTrac

  1.  You will need the SQLite library version 2.4.6 or later.  If you
      do not already have this library installed, obtain a copy from
      http://www.hwaci.com/sw/sqlite/

  2.  Choose a directory to compile in.  The directory in which you compile
      does not need to be the same as the source directory.  By default,
      the compilation directory should be a sibling of the source directory
      but this is not required.

  3.  Make a copy of linux-gcc.mk into the compilation directory and rename
      it 'Makefile'.

  4.  Edit the file you just copied to adjust the parameters to your system.

  5.  Type "make" to build the CVSTrac executable.

  6.  Copy the "cvstrac" executable to /usr/bin or /usr/local/bin or
      whereever you want to install it.

For additional on how CVSTrac is put together (information you may want
to know if you would like to try to make improvements to CVSTrac) see
the file called "howitworks.html".
