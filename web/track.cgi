<h2>Context</h2>
 
<p>At mySociety we're obsessed with making our sites usable &mdash; our goal is
always that by the time people leave one of our sites they've successfully
squeezed every ounce of goodness out of it.</p>

<p>In order to do this better we're building and rolling out a system
which allows us to understand where people get confused or lost on our
sites, and so helps us improve things so more people leave having got
what they wanted to from our sites.</p>

<h2>How?</h2>

<p>In order to tell if a page is confusing for users, we monitor how many
users successfully navigate from one page to the next, or how many
people successfully click on a confirmation link in an email. By
comparing data from two versions of the same page, or two versions of
the same email, we can work out which page is better at getting more
people 'through', and which is more confusing and causes more people
to leave the site.</p>

<h2>What does this mean to me?</h2>

<p>Some people might be concerned by the fact that we record how they and other
users make use of our sites. In order to be completely transparent (unlike most
services) we allow our users to see what data has been kept on their use of our
sites. Nobody else can see this except the user concerned. Further, our users
can opt out of tracking at any time.</p>
EOF
            ($track_cookie eq 'do-not-track-me'

                : $actionsform),
            <<EOF,

<h2>What data do you use for your analysis?</h2>

<p>We do not use names or email addresses for our analysis &mdash; we are only
interested in how users en-masse succeed or fail to use parts of our sites. In
accordance with the rest of our site's privacy policies, we will never sell or
give away any name, email or address data you submit to any of our sites,
except when required to make the sites function (i.e your MP has a right to
know your postal address if you contact them via WriteToThem.com).</p>

<h2>How does it work, technically?</h2>

<p>We use a "web bug" &mdash; a tiny, transparent image which can be added to
any page without altering its appearance, and a cookie containing a unique ID
number which is associated with that image. Each page that uses user-tracking
contains a reference to that image, and whenever we receive a request for the
image, we record some information from the referring page (unless the value of
the cookie is "do-not-track-me", indicating that the user has opted out).</p>

<h2>More information</h2>

<p>The Electronic Frontier Foundation has a
<a href="http://www.eff.org/Privacy/Marketing/web_bug.html">list of frequently
asked questions and answers</a> about "web bugs" and user tracking, and
Wikipedia has <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_bug">an article on
them</a> (though under the less-insidious-sounding name "web beacon").</p>
