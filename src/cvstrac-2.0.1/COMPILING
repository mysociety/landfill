How To Compile CVSTrac

  1.  You will need the SQLite library version 3.0.0 or newer. The 3.3.x
      series is recommended. If you do not already have this library installed, 
      obtain a copy from http://www.sqlite.org

  2.  Choose a directory to compile in.  The directory in which you compile
      does not need to be the same as the source directory.  By default,
      the compilation directory should be a sibling of the source directory
      but this is not required.

  3.  Make a copy of one of the platform-specific *.mk files into the
      compilation directory and rename it 'Makefile'. Currently available are:

        bsd-gcc.mk linux-gcc.mk linux-mingw.mk osx-gcc.mk

  4.  Edit the file you just copied to adjust the parameters to your system.

  5.  Type "make" to build the CVSTrac executable.
      Type "make APPNAME=svntrac" to build a SvnTrac executable.
      Type "make APPNAME=gittrac" to build a GitTrac executable.

  6.  Copy the resulting executable to /usr/bin or /usr/local/bin or
      wherever you want to install it.

want to know if you would like to try to make improvements to CVSTrac) see
