<h1>Welcome to the Ideas Bank</h1>

<p>Welcome to the Ideas Bank. You can use this resource to log ideas on how
to improve GNM digital products and associated services. This includes ideas
for improving content management and editorial tools, new product development
ideas for commercial, marketing and editorial departments and additions to
existing products.</p>

<p>Please note that we are interested in ideas for additional development,
not ideas for editorial content.</p>

<p>Before logging a new idea you will be led through a series of questions.
The more information you can provide, the easier it will be for the people
co-ordinating development work to understand and prioritise your idea.
